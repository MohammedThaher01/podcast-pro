🚀 Post-Submission Updates (After Hackathon Deadline)
As part of refining my submission for the Crayon’d GenAI Internship Hackathon, I've made the following improvements to enhance performance and stability:

🛠️ Fixed: Pinecone integration bug causing vector indexing issues

🧩 Improved: Error handling for more robust and user-friendly responses

⚡ Optimized: Refactored and cleaned up backend code for better readability and efficiency

📌 Note: The original demo video submitted for the hackathon remains unchanged. These backend improvements are purely to strengthen the project’s functionality.
